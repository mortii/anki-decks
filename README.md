The cards were gathered
from [Anime Sentence Banks](https://www.mediafire.com/folder/p17g5uk4phb41/User_Uploaded_Anki_Decks) and then adjusted
to make them work with the [Morphman add-on](https://ankiweb.net/shared/info/900801631) to improve the learning
workflow. The back of the cards include automatically color-coded words (morphs) based om how well you know them, buttons to show/hide embedded dictionaries and a link to open Japanese Stack Exchange. Text
added to the field 'my_notes' will be shown in a box under the english translation.
